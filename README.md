PROBLEM:
Analyst ratings from different analysts are available as independent PDFs. To get a wholistic view of an equity, one has to go through several PDFs to get an overview of the stock's current performance and future outlook. 

SOLUTION:
Using Agentic Doc Extractor, read analyst ratings pdfs from different analysts and print out a side-by-side data for each of them. The data could be price target, buy/sell ratings, summary of the recommendation, etc. 

The Agentic Document Extractor is located at: https://github.com/landing-ai/agentic-doc 

PRE-REQUISITE:

``` 
    conda create -n condavenv python=3.13.5
    conda activate condavenv
```
- To deactivate
```
    conda deactivate
```
