This figure presents two line charts evaluating operating efficiency metrics—ROIC and Return on Incremental Invested Capital—over six quarters from Q2 2023 to Q1 2025, with annotations on recent quarter-over-quarter changes.\n\nline charts:\n# ROIC (Return on Invested Capital)\nTitle & Axes :\n  • Title: \"ROIC\"\n  • Y-axis: Percentage scale from -2.0% to 4.0%\n  • X-axis: Quarters from Q2 23 to Q1 25\n  • Annotation: \"Change from previous quarter: UP▲\"\nData Points :\n  • Solid blue line: Actual ROIC\n  • Red dashed line: Adjusted ROIC\n  • Both series show values at each quarter; specific values not labeled, but trend is visible.\nDesign Encodings :\n  • Blue solid line for actual ROIC, red dashed line for adjusted ROIC.\n  • Shaded area under the lines.\nDistribution & Trends :\n  • Both lines start below 0% in Q2 23, rise steadily, and reach just above 4.0% by Q1 25.\n  • The lines closely track each other, with adjusted ROIC slightly below actual ROIC throughout.\n  • Notable upward trend, especially from Q3 23 onward.\n\n# Return on Incremental Invested Capital\nTitle & Axes :\n  • Title: \"RETURN ON INCREMENTAL INVESTED CAPITAL\"\n  • Y-axis: Percentage scale from -750.0% to 0.0%\n  • X-axis: Quarters from Q2 23 to Q1 25\n  • Annotation: \"Change from previous quarter: DOWN▼\"\nData Points :\n  • Single blue line representing the metric per quarter.\n  • No specific values labeled, but trend is visible.\nDesign Encodings :\n  • Blue solid line, shaded area under the line.\nDistribution & Trends :\n  • Starts at approximately -750% in Q2 23, rises sharply to near 0% by Q1 24, then declines to around -250% by Q3 24, recovers slightly, and ends near -250% in Q1 25.\n  • Volatile pattern with a sharp initial improvement, followed by a decline and partial recovery.\n\n# Headings and Annotations\n  • Main heading: \"OPERATING EFFICIENCY: WEAK\" (with \"WEAK\" in orange)\n  • Subheadings for each chart, with quarter-over-quarter change indicators (\"UP▲\" for ROIC, \"DOWN▼\" for Return on Incremental Invested Capital).\n\nAnalysis :\n  • ROIC and adjusted ROIC have shown consistent improvement over the period, moving from negative to positive territory, with the latest quarter marking the highest point.\n  • Return on Incremental Invested Capital, while improving dramatically from its lowest point, remains negative and has recently declined, indicating ongoing challenges in generating returns from new capital investments.\n  • The overall assessment of \"WEAK\" operating efficiency is likely due to the persistently negative and volatile incremental returns, despite improvements in overall ROIC. <!-- figure, from page 4 (l=0.054,t=0.142,r=0.946,b=0.418), with ID 1a08decd-db4c-427f-b7e7-9067bc08df9f -->\n\nSummary : This

For our purposes, the forecasted accrual component is an aggregate measurement of total accruals (short-term balance sheet accounts) that distinguishes between “normalized” and “extraordinary” accruals. The normalized accruals are based on historical relationships between sales and accruals and are dynamically adjusted over time to account for changes in the ratio between these two variables. Normally, short term accruals will grow as sales grow – i.e., the “normalized” measure. Discretionary accruals are the portion of accruals that are in excess of the base factor and therefore exceed the normal and are “extraordinary”. <!-- text, from page 9 (l=0.054,t=0.235,r=0.494,b=0.433), with ID d2dd28c1-7558-451f-91e8-cbc830d30236 -->\n\n**Adjusted Operating Cash Flow:** Adjusted Operating Cash Flow is reported operating cash flow less adjustments for one-time and non-operating items yielding a more realistic picture of a company's ongoing cash flow from operations. <!-- text, from page 9 (l=0.054,t=0.437,r=0.493,b=0.496), with ID 39e5629b-b708-4157-b00c-49604d191d3e -->\n\n**Adjusted Free Cash Flow:** Adjusted Free Cash Flow is reported operating cash flow less adjustments for one-time, non-operating items and capital expenditures.

The measure is a ratio of a company’s non-cash current assets to its non-interest bearing short-term liabilities.– These non-cash assets include items such as accounts receivable (which are essentially interest-free loans to customers) and inventory (which is subject to obsolescence or spoilage). The non-interest bearing liabilities are essentially interest-free loans to the company. A lower ratio implies tighter cash management for a company as it has less cash tied up in non-cash current assets and is able to utilize interest free loans from suppliers. <!-- text, from page 9 (l=0.055,t=0.578,r=0.493,b=0.746), with ID ddaad848-eaa2-4e67-9484-986ec9773836 -->\n\n**Cash Flow Return on Investment:** Cash Flow ROI is a measure of a company's ability to generate operating cash flow from its invested capital.

For our purposes, the forecasted accrual component is an aggregate measurement of total accruals (short-term balance sheet accounts) that distinguishes between “normalized” and “extraordinary” accruals. The normalized accruals are based on historical relationships between sales and accruals and are dynamically adjusted over time to account for changes in the ratio between these two variables. Normally, short term accruals will grow as sales grow – i.e., the “normalized” measure. Discretionary accruals are the portion of accruals that are in excess of the base factor and therefore exceed the normal and are “extraordinary”.","grounding":[{"page":9,"box":{"l":0.05352148413658142,"t":0.23496298491954803,"r":0.49435940384864807,"b":0.43271809816360474},"image_path":"grounding/jefferson-research_20250713_204107/page_9/ChunkType.text_d2dd28c1-7558-451f-91e8-cbc830d30236_0.png"}],"chunk_type":"text","chunk_id":"d2dd28c1-7558-451f-91e8-cbc830d30236"},{"text":"**Adjusted Operating Cash Flow:** Adjusted Operating Cash Flow is reported operating cash flow less adjustments for one-time and non-operating items yielding a more realistic picture of a company's ongoing cash flow from operations.","grounding":[{"page":9,"box":{"l":0.053997814655303955,"t":0.43677568435668945,"r":0.4932888150215149,"b":0.49585121870040894},"image_path":"grounding/jefferson-research_20250713_204107/page_9/ChunkType.text_39e5629b-b708-4157-b00c-49604d191d3e_0.png"}],"chunk_type":"text","chunk_id":"39e5629b-b708-4157-b00c-49604d191d3e"},{"text":"**Adjusted Free Cash Flow:** Adjusted Free Cash Flow is reported operating cash flow less adjustments for one-time, non-operating items and capital expenditures.
