Current Dividend Yield is 0.00%.\n  • Dividends are paid out of free cash, not net earnings.\n  • FC Payout Ratio is 0.00 now and was 0.00 a year ago.\n  • Higher FC Payout Ratio suggests greater likelihood of dividend increase.\n\n# Analysis :\n  • AMD has generated significant free cash in most years, with a notable dip in Q1 2024.\n  • No dividends have been paid in the observed period, as indicated by the absence of Div bars and a 0.00% dividend yield.\n  • The FC Payout Ratio remains at 0.00, indicating that none of the free cash is being used for dividends.\n  • The data suggests AMD is retaining its free cash rather than distributing it to shareholders as dividends. <!-- figure, from page 1 (l=0.044,t=0.577,r=0.971,b=0.874), with ID 043654da-b8cf-4957-8deb-b2d9d9838960

solid, with data points marked).\n  • Dual y-axes: left for bar values, right for US Dollars (in Millions) for the bars.\n  • Bars are grouped by quarter, with each metric shown side by side.\n\n# Distribution & Trends :\n  • Most metrics peak in Q1 2022, especially CFO and FC.\n  • ACC is negative in Q1 2021, positive in all other years.\n  • SL Growth % peaks in Q1 2022, then declines sharply to Q1 2024, with a slight recovery in Q1 2025.\n  • CAPX remains relatively stable and low across all years.\n\n# Analysis :\n  • AMD's financial metrics (ER, CFO, FC) show a strong peak in Q1 2022, followed by a decline and partial recovery by Q1 2025.\n  • Sales growth percentage (SL Growth %) follows a similar pattern, peaking in Q1 2022, dropping to a low in Q1 2024, and then rising slightly.\n  • CAPX remains stable and low, while ACC fluctuates, being negative only in Q1 2021.\n  • The data suggests a period of strong growth in 2022, a downturn, and then a modest rebound by 2025.","grounding":[{"page":1,"box":{"l":0.05835366249084473,"t":0.3399321734905243,"r":0.968386173248291,"b":0.5659503936767578},"image_path":"grounding/mclean-equity-research_20250713_204111/page_1/ChunkType.figure_2c5f202f-c8a3-42f7-97fe-b5be5694a63b_0.png"}],"chunk_type":"figure","chunk_id":"2c5f202f-c8a3-42f7-97fe-b5be5694a63b"},{"text":"Summary : This bar chart presents 5 years of Free Cash (FC) and Dividend (Div) data for AMD, illustrating the company's ability to pay dividends from free cash rather than net earnings, and highlighting the current and historical FC payout ratios and dividend yield.\n\nbar chart:\n# Title & Axes :\n  • Title: \"5 Years of FC & Dividend Data for AMD\"\n  • X-axis: Years/Quarters (Q1 2021, Q1 2022, Q1 2023, Q1 2024, Q1 2025)\n  • Y-axis: US Dollars (in Millions), range from 0 to 3500\n\n# Data Points :\n  • Series: FC (Free Cash)\n    – Q1 2021: ~1200 million USD\n    – Q1 2022: ~3200 million USD\n    – Q1 2023: ~2200 million USD\n    – Q1 2024: ~900 million USD\n    – Q1 2025: ~2700 million USD\n  • Series: Div (Dividend)\n    – No visible bars for Div in any year (implies zero or negligible values)\n\n# Design Encodings :\n  • FC bars: Cyan/teal color, labeled \"FC\"\n  • Div bars: Yellow color, labeled \"Div\" (not visible in the chart)\n  • Legend at top left for FC and Div\n  • Dual y-axis: Only right axis labeled (US Dollars in Millions)\n  • No error bars or statistical overlays\n\n# Distribution & Trends :\n  • FC values fluctuate over the 5-year period, peaking in Q1 2022 (~3200M), dipping in Q1 2024 (~900M), and recovering in Q1 2025 (~2700M).\n  • No dividend payouts are shown for any year.\n\n# Annotations & Notes :\n  • Current Dividend Yield is 0.00%.\n  • Dividends are paid out of free cash, not net earnings.\n  • FC Payout Ratio is 0.00 now and was 0.00 a year ago.\n  • Higher FC Payout Ratio suggests greater likelihood of dividend increase.\n\n# Analysis :\n  • AMD has generated significant free cash in most years, with a notable dip in Q1 2024.\n  • No dividends have been paid in the observed period, as indicated by the absence of Div bars and a 0.00% dividend yield.\n  • The FC Payout Ratio remains at 0.00, indicating that none of the free cash is being used for dividends.\n  • The data suggests AMD is retaining its free cash rather than distributing it to shareholders as dividends.","grounding":[{"page":1,"box":{"l":0.04401096701622009,"t":0.5765136480331421,"r":0.9710865020751953,"b":0.8743607997894287},"image_path":"grounding/mclean-equity-research_20250713_204111/page_1/ChunkType.figure_043654da-b8cf-4957-8deb-b2d9d9838960_0.png"}],"chunk_type":"figure","chunk_id":"043654da-b8cf-4957-8deb-b2d9d9838960"},{"text":"Semiconductors
