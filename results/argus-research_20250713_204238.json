These include AI data center, legacy cloud data center, Internet of Things (IoT) & factory automation, EV & hybrid EV, autonomous vehicles, robotics, and more.\n- The need for massive GPU clusters to train Large Language Models (LLMs) and for inferencing for generative AI has led to explosive demand for GPU computing implementations and has become as one of the most significant semiconductor drivers.\n- ARM-based cores (licensed from ARM Holdings Ltd.) that power smartphones and tablet PCs have disrupted the hegemony in processing once enjoyed by x86 architecture. Traditional x86 processor companies such as Intel and AMD are fighting back with lower-power products that integrate central processing and graphics processing within a single die.\n- The nature of memory is changing, with mobile computers transitioning away from hard disk drive-based memory (HDD) to solid-state memory (SSD).

Ratings for these companies are derived through a proprietary algorithm we have designed and tested so that the ratings are based on our fundamental Six-Point System. Our A6 Quantitative Ratings include sub-ratings for each of the six factors. <!-- text, from page 2 (l=0.040,t=0.127,r=0.557,b=0.223), with ID 7e2f756e-31d4-491b-8276-f5efc89bf6b7 -->\n\nThe A6 algorithm is designed to capture and analyze financial trends for each company under coverage. Companies are measured against their historical record, peer group, and the broad market. For each covered company, the A6 algorithm generates a subrating for growth, financial strength, industry outlook, management, risk/safety and valuation. These scores are totaled and provide an overall rating for each company. The A6 algorithm rates stocks on growth based on normalized earnings estimates and sales trends, among other factors. Our financial strength ranking is based primarily on balance sheet debt and liquidity ratios. For risk, we factor in liquidity, dividend yield, market cap, debt leverage and stock price beta. Our valuation subrating includes factors such as price/earnings and price/sales ratios, trend lines, and discounted cash flow valuations. Ratings are reviewed weekly. <!-- text, from page 2 (l=0.041,t=0.229,r=0.559,b=0.360), with ID 9b4c6596-500b-44d6-9b4c-80fa16a6ee7f -->\n\nArgus Research Disclaimer\n\nArgus Research Co.

sentiment by sector.\n\nbar chart:\n# Title & Axes :\n  • Title: \"RATING DISTRIBUTION SECTOR\".\n  • X-axis: Number of ratings (no explicit units, tick marks at 0, 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300).\n  • Y-axis: Sectors (Communication Services, Consumer Discretionary, Consumer Staples, Energy, Financial, Healthcare, Industrial, Information Technology, Materials, Real Estate, Utilities).\n\n# Data Points :\n  • Sectors listed (top to bottom): Communication Services, Consumer Discretionary, Consumer Staples, Energy, Financial, Healthcare, Industrial, Information Technology, Materials, Real Estate, Utilities.\n  • For each sector, three horizontal bars represent:\n    – Buy (green)\n    – Sell (red)\n    – Hold (yellow)\n  • Bar lengths (approximate, as exact values are not labeled) show the count of each rating per sector.\n\n# Design Encodings :\n  • Buy ratings: green bars.\n  • Sell ratings: red bars.\n  • Hold ratings: yellow bars.\n  • All bars are horizontal and grouped by sector.\n  • Legend at the bottom: green = Buy, red = Sell, yellow = Hold.\n\n# Distribution & Trends :\n  • Most sectors have the longest yellow (Hold) bars, indicating Hold is the most common rating.\n  • Sell (red) bars are generally the shortest across all sectors.\n  • Sectors like Financial, Healthcare, and Industrial have notably long Hold bars (approaching or exceeding 250).\n  • Buy (green) bars are present in all sectors but are shorter than Hold bars.\n  • Utilities and Real Estate have the shortest overall bars, indicating fewer total ratings.\n\n# Analysis :\n  • Hold is the dominant analyst rating across all sectors, especially in Financial, Healthcare, and Industrial.\n  • Sell ratings are rare in every sector.\n  • Sectors with the most analyst attention (highest total bar lengths) are Financial, Healthcare, and Industrial.\n  • Sectors like Utilities and Real Estate receive fewer ratings overall.\n  • The distribution suggests a generally cautious or neutral analyst sentiment, with few strong Buy or Sell recommendations. <!-- figure, from page 2 (l=0.583,t=0.128,r=0.942,b=0.312), with ID ca448955-f96e-41ca-99d8-61a9a3294b7a -->\n\nSummary : This figure presents the distribution of market capitalisation (market cap) categories—Large Cap, Mid Cap, and Small Cap—across three universes: all stocks, the Argus Fundamental Universe, and the Argus A6 (Quant) Universe, using pie charts.\n\npie charts:\n# Title & Categories :\n  • Main title: \"MARKET CAP DISTRIBUTION\".\n  • Three subgroups: \"ALL STOCKS\", \"ARGUS FUNDAMENTAL UNIVERSE\", \"ARGUS A6 (QUANT) UNIVERSE\".\n  • Legend: Large Cap (purple), Mid Cap (yellow), Small Cap (green).\n\n# Data Points :\n  • ALL STOCKS:\n    – Large Cap: 45.8%\n    – Mid Cap: 34.3%\n    – Small Cap: 19.8%\n

27.3%\n\n# Design Encodings :\n  • Pie charts with three segments each, colour-coded: purple (Large Cap), yellow (Mid Cap), green (Small Cap).\n  • Percentages labelled directly on each segment.\n  • Legend box clarifies colour-to-category mapping.\n\n# Distribution & Trends :\n  • ALL STOCKS: Distribution is spread across all three categories, with Large Cap being the largest segment.\n  • ARGUS FUNDAMENTAL UNIVERSE: Dominated by Large Cap stocks (over 86%), with very small Small Cap representation.\n  • ARGUS A6 (QUANT) UNIVERSE: More balanced, with Large Cap and Small Cap both near 45% and 27%, respectively.\n\n# Analysis :\n  • The Argus Fundamental Universe is heavily skewed toward Large Cap stocks, with minimal Small Cap presence.\n  • The Argus A6 (Quant) Universe has a more even distribution between Large, Mid, and Small Cap stocks, closely mirroring the overall \"All Stocks\" distribution but with a slightly higher Small Cap proportion.\n  • The \"All Stocks\" group shows a moderate spread, with Large Cap as the largest single category but not overwhelmingly dominant. <!-- figure, from page 2 (l=0.583,t=0.312,r=0.942,b=0.618), with ID cdce959b-66dd-44cf-a0d2-fea846f665e9

:\n  • Title: \"CURRENT RATING DISTRIBUTION\".\n  • X-axis: Rating categories (\"Buy\", \"Sell\", \"Hold\").\n  • Y-axis: Count (range: 0 to 1000, tick marks at 0, 200, 400, 600, 800, 1000).\n\nData Points :\n  • Buy: ~420 (26%).\n  • Sell: ~120 (12%).\n  • Hold: 1000 (62%).\n\nDesign Encodings :\n  • Buy: Dark green bar, labeled \"26%\".\n  • Sell: Red bar, labeled \"12%\".\n  • Hold: Orange bar, labeled \"62%\".\n  • Bars are vertical, with percentage labels centered at the top of each bar.\n\nDistribution & Trends :\n  • Hold ratings are the most frequent, comprising the majority (62%) of the total.\n  • Buy ratings are the second most common (26%).\n  • Sell ratings are the least common (12%).\n\nAnalysis :\n  • The distribution is heavily skewed toward Hold recommendations, with nearly two-thirds of ratings in this category.\n  • Buy ratings are more than double the Sell ratings, but both are much less frequent than Hold.\n  • The data suggests a strong analyst preference for neutral (Hold) recommendations over definitive Buy or Sell stances. <!-- figure, from page 2 (l=0.583,t=0.618,r=0.942,b=0.803), with ID 1ab54927-5c8f-4970-b852-47162f18f221 -->\n\ncovered company's
