Many firms that look profitable by EBITDA or EPS arenï¿½t when judged by EVA. EVA repairs other distortions: restructuring charges are added back, research is written off over time, leased assets are treated as if owned, and tax gyrations are smoothed. The result: EVA is a sounder measure of economic profit and more reliable indicator of added market value than reported earnings. <!-- text, from page 1 (l=0.055,t=0.437,r=0.946,b=0.501), with ID 23101ba9-d5ed-4539-806a-fed2024dab0b -->\n\nRisk is indicated by stock price and return volatility and reliance on debt financing, offset by ï¿½freeï¿½ cash generation, which betokens liquidity and staying power. <!-- text, from page 1 (l=0.054,t=0.505,r=0.945,b=0.537), with ID 98133c27-86b6-467e-a4d0-821089ea338c -->\n\nValuation is measured by Market Value Added (MVA) – the spread between a firm’s overall market value and its balance sheet capital – which is also the amount of wealth a company has created or destroyed. MVA and EVA should be linked. A firm’s MVA should equal its projected EVA profit, discounted to present value. If a firm just breaks even on EVA, its market value should nearly match its book capital. Only profitable, EVA expanding firms should trade for MVA premiums. Buy/Sell opportunities arise when MVAs are mis-aligned with the record for earning and increasing EVA. <!-- text, from page 1 (l=0.054,t=0.541,r=0.947,b=0.605), with ID 74057916-43b0-49d4-b50d-fcff85c84a95 -->\n\nSummary : This bar chart compares annual Sales and Capital (both in millions of dollars) from March 2020 (3/20) to March 2025 (3/25), and provides supporting text on sales growth and capital intensity.\n\nbar chart:\nTitle & Axes :\n  • No explicit title shown.\n  • X-axis: Years labeled as 3/20, 3/21, 3/22, 3/23, 3/24, 3/25.\n  • Y-axis: Values in millions, ranging from 0 to 75,000 (tick marks at 25,000, 50,000, 75,000).\n\nData Points :\n  • Series 1: Sales ($ in Millions), shown in light gray bars.\n  • Series 2: Capital ($ in Millions), shown in dark blue bars.\n  • Exact values are not labeled on the bars, but relative heights indicate:\n    – Sales are much lower than Capital in all years.\n    – Both Sales and Capital increase each year, with Capital showing a much steeper increase.\n    – By 3/25, Capital approaches 75,000 million, while Sales is below 25,000 million.\n\nDesign Encodings :\n  • Sales: light gray bars.\n  • Capital: dark blue bars.\n  • Dual bar groups for each year.\n  • No gridlines except for Y-axis reference lines.\n\nDistribution & Trends :\n  • Both Sales and Capital increase year-over-year.\n  • Capital is consistently much higher than Sales.\n  • The gap between Capital and Sales widens over time.\n\nSupporting Text :\n  • Sales growth has averaged 29%, but was 22% in the most recent year.\n  • On average, every dollar of Sales has been supported by Capital of $2.71.\n  • Capital intensity last year was $2.51 per $1.00 of sales.\n\nAnalysis :\n  • The company’s Capital base is growing rapidly, outpacing Sales growth.\n  • Capital intensity (Capital/Sales) remains high, though it decreased slightly last year.\n  • The widening gap suggests increasing investment or asset base relative to sales revenue.\n  • The supporting text quantifies growth rates and capital intensity, confirming the visual trend of high and rising capital requirements. <!-- figure, from page 1 (l=0.053,t=0.615,r=0.346,b=0.788), with ID e53c3f9f-6122-4f0b-9e9d-9d2df95a57fb -->\n\nSummary : This dual-axis bar and line chart shows AMD's Market Value Added (MVA) and Economic Value Added (EVA) in millions of dollars from July 2020 to July 2025, highlighting an inverse trend between the two metrics in recent years.\n\nbar and line chart:\nTitle & Axes :\n  • No explicit title;

Companies with high in-sector PRVit scores are bargains, offering relatively more real economic performance, net of risk, per unit of value, and thus they are expected to outperform other lesser rated firms in their sectors. <!-- text, from page 2 (l=0.053,t=0.170,r=0.946,b=0.229), with ID ec0486c5-afd7-4214-b6f0-96ecf23e55ae -->\n\nIn-sector PRVit scores are always equally distributed among the stocks in a sector, with a perfect balance between Buys and Sells, for instance, and a median score of 50 in all sectors, which means that any bias to favor one sector over another is removed. The in-sector scores tell which stocks to buy and which to sell once a decision to invest in a sector has been made. A company’s score in its sector is its official “PRVit” score, and determines its Buy/Hold/Sell rating. <!-- text, from page 2 (l=0.054,t=0.231,r=0.946,b=0.273), with ID b2be6068-6a2c-4ad7-b0d1-37e630b90ffd -->\n\n**PRVit Score vs. Market:** The percentile rank of a firm’s “intrinsic” value compared to its actual market valuation, rated against all Russell 3000 firms. A firm’s intrinsic value is based on its ability to predictably earn and increase EVA profit, as measured by its performance score (P) less its risk score (R). The firm’s actual market valuation score (V) is derived from a composite ranking of 4 valuation multiples generally based around MVA, the market value less book capital measure of shareholder wealth. The firm’s PRVit score is thus the ratio of its P score less its R score, divided by its V score, expressed as a percentile against all Russell 3000 firms. It is a comparative index of the firm’s risk-adjusted return on value. The higher the yield, the higher the score, and the more attractive the stock is to own. PRVit scores vs. the market implicitly incorporate the general outlook for the sector in which the company participates, and thus, the official PRVit score is measured “in-sector,” after removing the sector influence. <!-- text, from page 2 (l=0.054,t=0.274,r=0.947,b=0.355), with ID 3465d24e-fa45-4662-84db-855132bee753 -->\n\n**Sector Median Market Score and Removing the Sector Bias**: The median score is the PRVit score vs. the market that falls in the middle of the sector pack. A low median score is typical of sectors where investors are generally willing to pay high multiples of the past performance trends, and high median scores, the opposite – sectors where the market is heavily discounting past performance in setting current stock prices. Companies may thus be highly or lowly rated only because they are in a “value” or “growth” sector, or in one that’s generally rebounding or tumbling, and not because they are inherently good or bad investments. In-sector PRVit scores remove the sector bias by ranking companies solely against other firms in the same business line, which makes it the official “PRVit” score and basis for the Buy/Hold/Sell ratings. <!-- text, from page 2 (l=0.054,t=0.356,r=0.946,b=0.423), with ID 214e726d-673d-442e-9e6f-1705cd934559 -->\n\n**PRVit Scores & Ratings: Meaning & Distribution**: Stocks with “in-sector” PRVit Scores of 80-100 are rated Buy/Significant outperformance relative to sector peers, 60-79 are rated Overweight/Slight outperformance relative to sector peers, 40-59 are rated Hold/Performance in-line with the sector, 20-39 are rated Underweight/Slight underperformance relative to sector peers, and 0-19 are rated Sell/Significant underperformance relative to the sector. All five rating categories always have a distribution of 20%. PRVit has no built in bias to buy or sell stocks in general, but only, to identify those which represent the best and worst bets in their sector. <!-- text, from page 2 (l=0.054,t=0.424,r=0.946,b=0.478), with ID 2923d393-2e89-4788-98f0-f99a3f263f37 -->\n\nP: Performance Score: Indicates the firm's ability to justify a high valuation by earning and increasing economic profit (i.e., its EVA).

The yield a company is generating on the funds that creditors and shareholders have collectively invested in the firm. <!-- text, from page 3 (l=0.055,t=0.170,r=0.491,b=0.237), with ID 4dc4e0fc-2e64-4c97-a176-ced039c11016 -->\n\nROC is specifically defined as net operating profit after taxes, or NOPAT, as a percentage of total capital employed. “Capital” in this context is a firm’s total borrowings and its shareholders’ equity, or what is the same thing, its net operational assets – the sum of its working capital, fixed plant, equipment and property assets, and other assets, including intangibles. NOPAT is correspondingly the profit attributable to the capital – before deducting any interest or other financing expense – which makes ROC a gauge of a firm’s ability to productively invest and manage the resources put at its disposal regardless of how financed. <!-- text, from page 3 (l=0.055,t=0.240,r=0.494,b=0.345), with ID 0a2dbaa8-03a3-44d6-a361-dd8406c69dce -->\n\nNOPAT and capital are also measured after making a series of corrective adjustments that undo accounting distortions. Accounting rules mandate, for example, that research and development and advertising spending be written off against corporate earnings right away, as the money is spent. But in fact, such outlays are in the main vital investments that improve productivity and increase brand value and customer satisfaction. Therefore, a new rule is followed to measure NOPAT and capital, which is to add the outlays to balance sheet assets and to write them off over a period of years. That way, a boost in the spending doesn’t inexplicably diminish a company’s earnings and depress its ROC in the year it is spent. Rather, the cost is spread over time – to match the expected benefits. Another advantage is that the rate of return the firm is actually earning on its investments in innovation and in building brands can be more accurately gauged and compared with other firms. <!-- text, from page 3 (l=0.055,t=0.348,r=0.494,b=0.503), with ID e8811126-2ccf-445e-9332-a73b38536200 -->\n\nThe adjustments don’t stop there, of course. In the same spirit, restructuring charges and asset write-downs are taken out of earnings, and added back to balance sheet capital. Mere accounting strokes of the pen have no impact on ROC, therefore. Assets rented are added to capital as if they were owned, and the interest component of rent expense is added back to NOPAT. Surplus cash and the related income are set aside, so that a massive cash distribution to investors, such as Microsoft undertook in 2004, has no effect on ROC (though it sends ROE – return on equity – haywire). Period to period fluctuations in the effective tax rate, too, are smoothed to better reveal underlying profitability. All told, some 50 adjustments are called into play to correct bookkeeping flaws. <!-- text, from page 3 (l=0.055,t=0.506,r=0.494,b=0.634), with ID d01ada63-f80e-4c8d-be51-c7286e246f45 -->\n\nThe result is that unlike the conventional ROE computed from reported financial figures, the ROC measure that ISS-EVA uses enables more uniform and informative comparisons of performance over time for a given company, and across firms and sectors that are inherently quite different in their business models and financial make-up. It neutralizes the varying degrees to which firms use intangible capital (like patents, know how, and brands) vs. tangible capital (inventories and plant), the mix of owning versus leasing assets, and the mix of debt versus equity financing, to name a few. <!-- text, from page 3 (l=0.055,t=0.638,r=0.493,b=0.730), with ID 6ecd5689-cf54-4f6d-a631-9a5d22896d23 -->\n\nFinancial institutions require a special treatment. Financing assets with appropriate funding sources is an operating decision for a financial intermediary, and interest expense is akin to cost of goods sold. Hence, “capital” defined as common equity capital, as adjusted, and NOPAT is measured after treating interest expense as an operating expense. <!-- text, from page 3 (l=0.056,t=0.734,r=0.493,b=0.799), with ID 1ae9f1c6-ac07-479f-8b12-40d6c0f08349 -->\n\n**Economic Value Added (EVA).** EVA is the name given to a special way of measuring corporate profit that follows economic logic rather than doggedly conforming to accounting rules. The chief difference is that, under EVA, profit is measured after setting aside a minimum return to compensate shareholders for bearing risk, which is an invisible but nevertheless quite real “opportunity cost” that accounting records miss entirely. EVA recognizes that a firm isn’t really profitable until it earns at least the return that its shareholders could earn on their own by investing in an equally risky basket of stocks. This one change means that many companies that appear to be profitable and profitably expanding when judged by their EBITDA or net income or EPS, aren’t really profitable at all when judged by the EVA standard. <!-- text, from page 3 (l=0.056,t=0.803,r=0.494,b=0.932), with ID 9f68df53-0d51-4b11-9130-d6250d142bba -->\n\nTo be specific, EVA is computed as net operating profit after tax, or NOPAT, less a <!-- text, from page 3 (l=0.056,t=0.936,r=0.492,b=0.951), with ID 615770ed-1fbd-4094-ad20-f5e63e3b0899 -->\n\n“capital charge” one computes by multiplying the firm’s capital by the overall, weighted average percent interest cost of its debt and equity capital (a figure that is generally 7%–12%, depending on the risk of the firm). EVA may also be thought of as the percent spread between a firm’s return on capital (ROC) and its cost of capital (COC), times the amount of capital it employs. In other words, it is thus the dollar spread of the return on capital less the cost of capital. <!-- text, from page 3 (l=0.507,t=0.169,r=0.945,b=0.247), with ID 42644dab-6ff1-49b0-8f3d-a7cfedd6ea74 -->\n\nA firm's EVA increases when it pares wasteful costs and earns a higher ROC on its installed capital base, when it grows by investing new capital in projects and strategies that more than cover the threshold return, and when it releases capital that is earning beneath its cost – such as by improving asset turns, paring marginal lines of business or selling or outsourcing assets worth more to others. Thus, an increase in a firm's EVA, even if it is just making a negative EVA less negative, is as sure a sign a company is making progress as generally exists, and that it is increasing the value of the firm above the capital invested in it, spread which goes by the name of MVA, standing for \"market value added.\" <!-- text, from page 3 (l=0.507,t=0.251,r=0.945,b=0.367), with ID 9f78379d-4402-436b-a546-52977f3c76ff -->\n\n**EVA Spread.** The ratio of EVA/Capital, which is also the same as the percent spread between ROC and COC. It shows whether and by how much the firm's return on capital – properly measured – exceeds, or falls shorts, of covering it overall, weighted average cost of debt and equity capital. <!-- text, from page 3 (l=0.507,t=0.371,r=0.945,b=0.424), with ID 74eaa46e-9459-4f65-b571-625949bdae27 -->\n\n**EVA Margin.** The ratio of EVA/Sales; it is the percentage of sales that ends up as EVA after all operating expenses and capital charges have been paid. It is the single best measure of a company's profit margin because it accurately consolidates pricing power, operational efficiency and the quality of asset management into one overall score. <!-- text, from page 3 (l=0.507,t=0.428,r=0.945,b=0.482), with ID 4cc8e27c-709e-4a5a-8513-af7694c4a5e3 -->\n\nIn so doing, the EVA margin makes it possible to compare meaningfully compare asset\nlight service businesses that require little capital, and which like Wal-Mart can generate\nan outstanding EVA with relatively meager operating margins, versus companies in asset\nintense sectors, such as semiconductor fabricators or paper mill operators that must tie\nup significant capital to generate sales, and which therefore are obliged to earn far\nhigher operating margins to cover the cost of their capital before they can begin to earn\nEVA. <!-- text, from page 3 (l=0.507,t=0.485,r=0.945,b=0.576), with ID a6a5cc0a-c14c-4438-a163-647d808db1c9 -->\n\n**EVA Momentum.** It is the change in a firm's economic profit in a given period divided by its sales in the prior period. For example, if a company increases its EVA by $10 million on last year's sales base of $1 billion, then its EVA Momentum is 1% for the year. Said another way, it is the size-adjusted change in economic profit. It is the only financial ratio where a bigger number is always better, because it's the only ratio that always increases only when EVA does. That cannot be said of profit margin, return on capital, or sales or earnings growth rates, for instance. All of them can \"improve\" when a firm's performance and value are actually deteriorating. <!-- text, from page 3 (l=0.507,t=0.580,r=0.945,b=0.683), with ID fad45b5b-7e54-427a-bacf-ee9ee24372a6 -->\n\nEVA Momentum levels cross-company comparisons by scaling results according to size and also by measuring performance improvements – focusing on changes in EVA – which ignores legacy assets or liabilities that are already reflected in the level of EVA that is being earned. It is, for instance, positive for negative EVA businesses that are on the mend, and negative for positive EVA businesses that are slipping. EVA Momentum is thus the financial “canary in the cave,” presciently signaling changes of direction in advance of conventional measures like EBITDA, EPS or ROE, which do not adequately charge profit for the use of investors’ capital. <!-- text, from page 3 (l=0.507,t=0.687,r=0.945,b=0.791), with ID e8cdee27-7287-428a-ae91-4fb8b6590fe3 -->\n\nValuation Metrics:\n\nMarket Value Added (MVA). The spread between a company’s overall market value and the capital employed on its balance sheet. It is the difference between the sum of cash that investors have put into or left in the business as its capital and the present value of the cash they could expect to take out of it, if only by selling their shares. As such, it represents how much wealth the firm has created. The period to period change in MVA, when coupled with the EVA profit actually earned, determines the rate of return the firm generates for its investors on the market value of their investment in the firm. <!-- text, from page 3 (l=0.507,t=0.796,r=0.944,b=0.907), with ID d8da46b0-3855-4c29-a84f-a985d10cfbff -->\n\nIn principle, a firm is fairly valued when its MVA is priced to equal the expected sum of the EVA profit it is able to earn in the future, after discounting to a present value.

Negative free cash generation is interpreted as a higher risk proposition. For one, it stretches out the duration of the firm's cash generation. For another, it may be the result of aggressive and unproven acquisition spending. Regardless, negative FCF generation requires external financing, and that puts the firm's growth at the mercy of market access.

Therefore, a new rule is followed to measure NOPAT and capital, which is to add the outlays to balance sheet assets and to write them off over a period of years. That way, a boost in the spending doesn’t inexplicably diminish a company’s earnings and depress its ROC in the year it is spent.

Surplus cash and the related income are set aside, so that a massive cash distribution to investors, such as Microsoft undertook in 2004, has no effect on ROC (though it sends ROE – return on equity – haywire).

This one change means that many companies that appear to be profitable and profitably expanding when judged by their EBITDA or net income or EPS, aren’t really profitable at all when judged by the EVA standard.","grounding":[{"page":3,"box":{"l":0.05592840909957886,"t":0.8034844398498535,"r":0.4935782551765442,"b":0.9322129487991333},"image_path":"grounding/iss-eva-research_20250713_204008/page_3/ChunkType.text_9f68df53-0d51-4b11-9130-d6250d142bba_0.png"}],"chunk_type":"text","chunk_id":"9f68df53-0d51-4b11-9130-d6250d142bba"},{"text":"To be specific, EVA is computed as net operating profit after tax, or NOPAT, less a","grounding":[{"page":3,"box":{"l":0.05634509027004242,"t":0.9363795518875122,"r":0.49197953939437866,"b":0.9510155916213989},"image_path":"grounding/iss-eva-research_20250713_204008/page_3/ChunkType.text_615770ed-1fbd-4094-ad20-f5e63e3b0899_0.png"}],"chunk_type":"text","chunk_id":"615770ed-1fbd-4094-ad20-f5e63e3b0899"},{"text":"“capital charge” one computes by multiplying the firm’s capital by the overall, weighted average percent interest cost of its debt and equity capital (a figure that is generally 7%–12%, depending on the risk of the firm).

The higher the multiple, the more the firm must be able to reinvest its EBITDAR in EVA-enhancing investments and strategies.","grounding":[{"page":4,"box":{"l":0.5065768361091614,"t":0.2011084407567978,"r":0.9455018639564514,"b":0.27939730882644653},"image_path":"grounding/iss-eva-research_20250713_204008/page_4/ChunkType.text_db54aabd-6db3-40ba-a96d-9f761c2ce2f3_0.png"}],"chunk_type":"text","chunk_id":"db54aabd-6db3-40ba-a96d-9f761c2ce2f3"},{"text":"Risk Metrics:\n\nVolatility.
