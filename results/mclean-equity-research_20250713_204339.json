data shows a marked improvement in both ROE and EP starting mid-2024, with both metrics reaching their highest values in late 2025.\n  • EP lags behind ROE throughout but follows a similar upward trend.\n  • The negative EP in Q4 2023 is a notable anomaly.\n  • The overall trend suggests significant shareholder value growth beginning in 2024 and stabilizing at high levels by 2025. <!-- figure,

values remain extremely low and nearly constant across all periods\n\n# Annotations & Notes :\n  • Current Dividend Yield is 0.03%\n  • Explanation: Dividends are paid out of free cash, not net earnings\n  • FC Payout Ratio: 73.53 (current), 99.83 (a year ago)\n  • Note: Higher FC payout ratio increases likelihood of dividend increase\n\n# Analysis :\n  • The company’s free cash flow has surged dramatically in the last two years shown (Q1 2025 and Q1 2026), while dividend payments have remained minimal and flat.\n  • The low dividend yield (0.03%) and low dividend bars suggest that NVDA is retaining most of its free cash rather than distributing it to shareholders.\n  • The FC payout ratio has decreased, indicating a lower proportion of free cash being paid out as dividends, which may suggest capacity for future dividend increases if desired.\n  • The visual gap between FC and Div bars highlights the company’s strong cash generation relative to its dividend commitments.

(a year ago)\n  • Note: Higher FC payout ratio increases likelihood of dividend increase\n\n# Analysis :\n  • The company’s free cash flow has surged dramatically in the last two years shown (Q1 2025 and Q1 2026), while dividend payments have remained minimal and flat.\n  • The low dividend yield (0.03%) and low dividend bars suggest that NVDA is retaining most of its free cash rather than distributing it to shareholders.\n  • The FC payout ratio has decreased, indicating a lower proportion of free cash being paid out as dividends, which may suggest capacity for future dividend increases if desired.\n  • The visual gap between FC and Div bars highlights the company’s strong cash generation relative to its dividend commitments.","grounding":[{"page":1,"box":{"l":0.04472607374191284,"t":0.5761497616767883,"r":0.9701939225196838,"b":0.8740505576133728},"image_path":"grounding/mclean-equity-research_20250713_204339/page_1/ChunkType.figure_f24cf3ef-ea64-4d79-ba19-e3c0fe8c42bd_0.png"}],"chunk_type":"figure","chunk_id":"f24cf3ef-ea64-4d79-ba19-e3c0fe8c42bd"},{"text":"Semiconductors
