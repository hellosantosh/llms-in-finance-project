The growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphic processing units (GPUs) based on NVIDIA’s Hopper and Blackwell architectures is aiding data center revenues. Continued ramp-up of Ada RTX GPU workstations in the ProViz end market, following the normalization of channel inventory, is acting as a tailwind. Collaborations with over 320 automakers and tier-one suppliers are likely to advance its presence in the autonomous vehicles space. We expect NVIDIA’s revenues to witness a CAGR of 28.95% through fiscal 2026-2028. However, a limited supply of Blackwell and Ada GPUs could hinder its ability to meet demand. Rising costs associated with the production of more complex AI systems will hurt margins. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.047,t=0.193,r=0.456,b=0.442), with ID d7946999-2683-4754-9410-58c087d05429

As more and more businesses are shifting toward cloud, the need for datacenters is increasing. To cater to this huge demand, datacenter operators like Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet are expanding their operations across the world, which is driving demand for the GPUs. This bodes well for NVIDIA’s uptrend as well. Further, the company intends to focus on new growth boosters for its data center business, such as inference, data science and machine learning techniques to consolidate its presence in this niche market. Considered most preferred by the datacenter operators, NVIDIA’s GPUs are likely to help the company grab a larger market space. Additionally, the datacenter end-market business is likely to benefit from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using GPUs based on NVIDIA Hopper and Blackwell architectures. The strong demand for its chips from large cloud service and consumer internet companies is anticipated to continue aiding the segment’s top-line growth. Our estimates suggest that the company’s revenues from the Data Center end market should witness a CAGR of 30.26% through fiscal 2026-2028.\n\n- ▲ NVIDIA is rapidly gaining traction in enterprise AI, expanding its market beyond cloud providers. Major companies across industries are integrating NVIDIA’s AI platforms to automate workflows, enhance productivity and improve decision-making. The company’s DGX Cloud AI infrastructure, which allows enterprises to train and deploy AI models at scale, has seen increased adoption. Meanwhile, the expansion of CUDA software and AI frameworks strengthens NVIDIA’s ecosystem, making it the preferred choice for enterprises developing AI applications. With AI adoption expected to accelerate in 2025 and beyond, NVIDIA’s Software and AI cloud solutions present another significant revenue driver.\n\n- ▲ The generative AI revolution continues to be a tailwind for NVIDIA. The company’s Hopper 200 and upcoming Blackwell GPUs are designed for training and inference of large language models, recommendation engines and generative AI applications. During the fourth quarter of the fiscal 2025 earnings call, CEO Jensen Huang highlighted the growing adoption of reasoning AI models, which require significantly higher computational power. NVIDIA’s Blackwell Ultra GPUs, set to launch later in 2025, are expected to deliver up to 25x the token throughput for AI inference compared to Hopper 100, further solidifying NVIDIA’s dominance in AI-driven computing. Additionally, AI adoption is spreading beyond cloud hyperscalers, with industries such as healthcare, automotive, and robotics increasingly investing in AI-powered solutions. This diversification ensures NVIDIA continues to grow beyond its traditional customer base.\n\n- ▲ NVIDIA’s foray into the autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space is a positive. The company currently is on a firmer footing in the autonomous vehicle market. It is working with more than 320 automakers, tier-one suppliers, automotive research institutions, HD mapping companies and start-ups to develop and deploy AI systems for self-driving vehicles. Notably, NVIDIA’s focus on incorporating AI into the cockpit for infotainment systems is allowing it to grow its autonomous driving revenues. The company sees a $300 billion revenue opportunity in this space, and its automotive revenues have already hit a $1.7 billion annual revenue run rate.\n\n- ▲ NVIDIA is a cash-rich company with a strong balance sheet and can be considered as a below-average leveraged company as its total debt to total capital ratio of 0.16 is significantly lower than the industry average of 0.30.As of April 27, 2025, the company had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of nearly $53.7 billion, which is significantly higher than its total long-term debt of $8.46 billion. Since it has net cash available on its balance sheet, the existing cash can be used for pursuing strategic acquisitions, investing in growth initiatives and distributing to its shareholders.\n\n- ▲ NVIDIA boasts a sturdy cash-flow generating ability. The company’s accelerated revenue growth along with improving operating efficiency is bringing in higher cash flows. In fiscal 2025, the company generated operating and free cash flow of $64.1 billion and $60.72 billion, respectively.In the first quarter of fiscal 2026, it generated operating and free cash flows of $27.4 billion and $26.14 billion, respectively. The higher cash flow generating ability lends NVIDIA flexibility to invest in long-term growth prospects and return money to its shareholders. In fiscal 2025, the company returned $4.54 billion to its shareholders through $834 million in dividend payouts and $33.71 billion in share repurchases. In the quarter ended April 2026, the company returned $244 million to its shareholders through dividend payouts and repurchased stocks worth $14.1 billion. As of April 27, 2025, the company has the remaining authorization of approximately $24.3 billion.\n\nGrowth opportunities in ray-traced gaming, high-performance computing, AI and self-driving cars are encouraging. <!-- text, from page 2 (l=0.045,t=0.036,r=0.982,b=0.700), with ID bd59c7da-5978-47c5-87b0-0f062e5c0577 -->\n\nZacks Equity Research <!-- marginalia, from page 2 (l=0.043,t=0.965,r=0.199,b=0.982), with ID c39eaa40-643c-41f7-8b6b-0b7910a6c000 -->\n\nwww.zacks.com <!-- marginalia, from page 2 (l=0.453,t=0.966,r=0.566,b=0.981), with ID 4dd607d7-4462-4da7-86bb-41c80aaf457c -->\n\nPage 3 of 11 <!-- marginalia, from page 2 (l=0.883,t=0.965,r=0.974,b=0.982), with ID 9c8f8dee-017f-44d6-9ca6-10af6c7dd025 -->\n\nReasons To Sell:\n\n▼ The United States and China’s tit-for-tat trade war is a major threat to the company. This is because the United States is the largest semiconductor manufacturing country, with China being its biggest importer. The trade war between the two countries has escalated over the past few years, and the U.S. government has imposed export restrictions on NVIDIA’s several AI chips. These restrictions have been significantly hurting NVIDIA’s data center chip sales in China. During the first quarter fiscal 2026 earnings call, the company revealed that it lost $2.5 billion in H20 chip sales in China during the quarter. It further expects to miss $8 billion in H20 sales during the second quarter.\n\n▼ NVIDIA’s near-term prospects might be hurt by softening IT spending. The still-high interest rates and protracted inflationary conditions have impacted consumer spending. Meanwhile, enterprises are postponing their large IT spending plans due to a weakening global economy amid ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical issues. This does not bode well for NVIDIA’s prospects in the near term.\n\n▼ NVIDIA’s reliance on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) for GPU production presents significant supply chain risks, particularly given the ongoing geopolitical tensions between China and Taiwan. A disruption in TSMC’s supply chain — whether due to geopolitical instability, trade restrictions, or capacity constraints — could severely impact NVIDIA’s ability to meet demand. Given the growing tension between the United States and China, further export restrictions on advanced AI chips could also limit NVIDIA’s ability to sell high-end GPUs in key markets like China, potentially impacting revenue growth. Additionally, U.S. regulatory scrutiny on AI chip exports to China continues to be a major headwind. If additional restrictions are imposed on selling AI accelerators to Chinese companies, NVIDIA’s growth prospects in one of its largest markets could be significantly hindered.\n\n▼ While NVIDIA is the dominant player in AI computing, competition is intensifying. AMD’s MI300 AI accelerators and Intel’s Gaudi AI chips are gaining traction, offering cost-effective alternatives for enterprises looking to diversify away from NVIDIA’s high-priced GPUs. Additionally, cloud giants like Amazon, Google and Microsoft are developing their own AI chips, which could reduce their reliance on NVIDIA’s GPUs over the long term. If these proprietary AI chips prove effective, NVIDIA may lose market share in its most profitable segment. Furthermore, NVIDIA’s Hopper and Blackwell GPUs require substantial capital investment from customers and cost-sensitive enterprises may opt for lower-cost solutions from competing vendors.\n\n▼ Despite strong revenue growth, NVIDIA’s gross margins declined in the first quarter of fiscal 2026, with non-GAAP gross margin slipping 12.5 percentage points sequentially to 61%. This decline was primarily due to a $4.5 billion charge related to H20 inventory and purchase commitments that became unsellable following the new U.S. export restrictions on H20 chip shipments to China. Also, higher production costs associated with transitioning to more complex AI systems weighed on gross margin. Additionally, operating expenses increased 43% year over year and 6% sequentially due to higher compensation and research & development investments. While necessary for long-term innovation, rising costs could eat into profitability if revenue growth slows in the coming quarters. With new product launches, including the Blackwell GPU series, expected to roll out later in 2025, cost pressures are likely to persist, further weighing on margins.\n\n▼ A substantial portion of the company’s sales is derived from outside the United States. Sales revenues to customers outside the United States accounted for more than 53% of the total revenue for fiscal 2025. Hence, we believe that any unfavorable currency fluctuation amid an uncertain macroeconomic environment may moderate the company’s growth.\n\nThe ongoing trade war between the United States and China, forex headwinds and stiff competition from AMD are major headwinds. <!-- text, from page 3 (l=0.047,t=0.038,r=0.980,b=0.588), with ID 28b79b2f-662c-4dfc-9cba-f9646c66cc33 -->\n\nZacks Equity Research <!-- marginalia, from page 3 (l=0.043,t=0.964,r=0.199,b=0.982), with ID a7c5af7b-dc83-4aa4-9c9e-359d3f4792b7 -->\n\nwww.zacks.com <!-- marginalia, from page 3 (l=0.453,t=0.967,r=0.566,b=0.981), with ID cc559492-333c-44f4-973f-6fdbe41bd1aa -->\n\nPage 4 of 11 <!-- marginalia, from page 3 (l=0.883,t=0.965,r=0.974,b=0.981), with ID e0a5dc27-68e3-4769-904c-ab6bbe7aa7ba -->\n\nLast Earnings Report\nNVIDIA Q1 Earnings Miss Expectations, Revenues Increase Y/Y <!-- text, from page 4 (l=0.048,t=0.037,r=0.525,b=0.079), with ID 7cb938fc-f397-472c-a9e1-03826fe9d962 -->\n\nNVIDIA reported first-quarter fiscal 2026 non-GAAP earnings of 81 cents per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.71%.

investors' holding horizons: Zacks Rank and Zacks Recommendation. Each provides valuable insights into the future profitability of the stock and can be used separately or in combination with each other depending on your investment style. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.047,t=0.037,r=0.978,b=0.096), with ID 5bcab847-5af5-48df-a89e-d03bace044c2 -->\n\nZacks Recommendation\n\nThe Zacks Recommendation aims to predict performance over the next 6 to 12 months. The foundation for the quantitatively determined Zacks Recommendation is trends in the company's estimate revisions and earnings outlook. The Zacks Recommendation is broken down into 3 Levels; Outperform, Neutral and Underperform. Unlike many Wall Street firms, we have an excellent balance between the number of Outperform and Neutral recommendations. Our team of 70 analysts are fully versed in the benefits of earnings estimate revisions and how that is harnessed through the Zacks quantitative rating system. But we have given our analysts the ability to override the Zacks Recommendation for the 1200 stocks that they follow. The reason for the analyst over-rides is that there are often factors such as valuation, industry conditions and management effectiveness that a trained investment professional can spot better than a quantitative model. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.048,t=0.106,r=0.979,b=0.230), with ID c40abc1d-5b97-4886-9d5f-f2f62bea9777 -->\n\nZacks Rank\nThe Zacks Rank is our short-term rating system that is most effective over the one- to three-month holding horizon. The underlying driver for the quantitatively-determined Zacks Rank is the same as the Zacks Recommendation, and reflects trends in earnings estimate revisions. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.048,t=0.243,r=0.978,b=0.300), with ID 554fd546-5f33-48be-aaf0-b1ee4754f74a -->\n\nZacks Style Scores\n\nThe Zacks Style Score is as a complementary indicator to the Zacks rating system, giving investors a way to focus on the highest rated stocks that best fit their own stock picking preferences. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.049,t=0.319,r=0.738,b=0.375), with ID 067b6ce3-a8c7-4300-b668-161aac64c5c6 -->\n\nAcademic research has proven that stocks with the best Value, Growth and Momentum characteristics outperform the market. The Zacks Style Scores rate stocks on each of these individual styles and assigns a rating of A, B, C, D and F. We also produce the VGM Score (V for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual Style Scores into one score. This is perfectly suited for those who want their stocks to have the best scores across the board. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.049,t=0.381,r=0.737,b=0.454), with ID ead3ae0a-b209-4248-ae1f-8eb6c43a6659 -->\n\nSummary : This figure presents four investment-related scores—Value Score, Growth Score, Momentum Score, and VGM Score—each assigned a letter grade.\n\ntable:\nScores and Grades :\n  • Value Score: D\n  • Growth Score: D\n  • Momentum Score: D\n  • VGM Score: C\n\nDesign Encodings :\n  • Each score is paired with a boxed letter grade.\n  • The VGM Score grade \"C\" is highlighted with a black background and white text, while the others have a grey background.\n\nAnalysis :\n  • All individual component scores (Value, Growth, Momentum) are graded \"D\", indicating lower performance in these areas.\n  • The composite VGM Score is \"C\", slightly higher than the individual components, suggesting a modest improvement when combined. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.750,t=0.342,r=0.975,b=0.457), with ID 5d2912a9-3139-489f-b212-93dfe5c6cdd1 -->\n\nAs an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means buying stocks with a Zacks Recommendation of Outperform, which also has a Style Score of an A or a B. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.049,t=0.462,r=0.977,b=0.491), with ID 097c4d54-ab38-4035-a3dc-e2ef1fa49867 -->\n\nDisclosures\n\nThis report contains independent commentary to be used for informational purposes only.

The growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphic processing units (GPUs) based on NVIDIA’s Hopper and Blackwell architectures is aiding data center revenues. Continued ramp-up of Ada RTX GPU workstations in the ProViz end market, following the normalization of channel inventory, is acting as a tailwind. Collaborations with over 320 automakers and tier-one suppliers are likely to advance its presence in the autonomous vehicles space. We expect NVIDIA’s revenues to witness a CAGR of 28.95% through fiscal 2026-2028. However, a limited supply of Blackwell and Ada GPUs could hinder its ability to meet demand. Rising costs associated with the production of more complex AI systems will hurt margins.","grounding":[{"page":0,"box":{"l":0.04737347364425659,"t":0.1934482753276825,"r":0.45552700757980347,"b":0.44190946221351624},"image_path":"grounding/zacks-research_20250713_204442/page_0/ChunkType.text_d7946999-2683-4754-9410-58c087d05429_0.png"}],"chunk_type":"text","chunk_id":"d7946999-2683-4754-9410-58c087d05429"},{"text":"Data

As more and more businesses are shifting toward cloud, the need for datacenters is increasing. To cater to this huge demand, datacenter operators like Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet are expanding their operations across the world, which is driving demand for the GPUs. This bodes well for NVIDIA’s uptrend as well. Further, the company intends to focus on new growth boosters for its data center business, such as inference, data science and machine learning techniques to consolidate its presence in this niche market. Considered most preferred by the datacenter operators, NVIDIA’s GPUs are likely to help the company grab a larger market space. Additionally, the datacenter end-market business is likely to benefit from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using GPUs based on NVIDIA Hopper and Blackwell architectures. The strong demand for its chips from large cloud service and consumer internet companies is anticipated to continue aiding the segment’s top-line growth. Our estimates suggest that the company’s revenues from the Data Center end market should witness a CAGR of 30.26% through fiscal 2026-2028.\n\n- ▲ NVIDIA is rapidly gaining traction in enterprise AI, expanding its market beyond cloud providers. Major companies across industries are integrating NVIDIA’s AI platforms to automate workflows, enhance productivity and improve decision-making. The company’s DGX Cloud AI infrastructure, which allows enterprises to train and deploy AI models at scale, has seen increased adoption. Meanwhile, the expansion of CUDA software and AI frameworks strengthens NVIDIA’s ecosystem, making it the preferred choice for enterprises developing AI applications. With AI adoption expected to accelerate in 2025 and beyond, NVIDIA’s Software and AI cloud solutions present another significant revenue driver.\n\n- ▲ The generative AI revolution continues to be a tailwind for NVIDIA. The company’s Hopper 200 and upcoming Blackwell GPUs are designed for training and inference of large language models, recommendation engines and generative AI applications. During the fourth quarter of the fiscal 2025 earnings call, CEO Jensen Huang highlighted the growing adoption of reasoning AI models, which require significantly higher computational power. NVIDIA’s Blackwell Ultra GPUs, set to launch later in 2025, are expected to deliver up to 25x the token throughput for AI inference compared to Hopper 100, further solidifying NVIDIA’s dominance in AI-driven computing. Additionally, AI adoption is spreading beyond cloud hyperscalers, with industries such as healthcare, automotive, and robotics increasingly investing in AI-powered solutions. This diversification ensures NVIDIA continues to grow beyond its traditional customer base.\n\n- ▲ NVIDIA’s foray into the autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space is a positive. The company currently is on a firmer footing in the autonomous vehicle market. It is working with more than 320 automakers, tier-one suppliers, automotive research institutions, HD mapping companies and start-ups to develop and deploy AI systems for self-driving vehicles. Notably, NVIDIA’s focus on incorporating AI into the cockpit for infotainment systems is allowing it to grow its autonomous driving revenues. The company sees a $300 billion revenue opportunity in this space, and its automotive revenues have already hit a $1.7 billion annual revenue run rate.\n\n- ▲ NVIDIA is a cash-rich company with a strong balance sheet and can be considered as a below-average leveraged company as its total debt to total capital ratio of 0.16 is significantly lower than the industry average of 0.30.As of April 27, 2025, the company had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of nearly $53.7 billion, which is significantly higher than its total long-term debt of $8.46 billion. Since it has net cash available on its balance sheet, the existing cash can be used for pursuing strategic acquisitions, investing in growth initiatives and distributing to its shareholders.\n\n- ▲ NVIDIA boasts a sturdy cash-flow generating ability. The company’s accelerated revenue growth along with improving operating efficiency is bringing in higher cash flows. In fiscal 2025, the company generated operating and free cash flow of $64.1 billion and $60.72 billion, respectively.In the first quarter of fiscal 2026, it generated operating and free cash flows of $27.4 billion and $26.14 billion, respectively. The higher cash flow generating ability lends NVIDIA flexibility to invest in long-term growth prospects and return money to its shareholders. In fiscal 2025, the company returned $4.54 billion to its shareholders through $834 million in dividend payouts and $33.71 billion in share repurchases. In the quarter ended April 2026, the company returned $244 million to its shareholders through dividend payouts and repurchased stocks worth $14.1 billion. As of April 27, 2025, the company has the remaining authorization of approximately $24.3 billion.\n\nGrowth opportunities in ray-traced gaming, high-performance computing, AI and self-driving cars are encouraging.","grounding":[{"page":2,"box":{"l":0.045181483030319214,"t":0.0362163782119751,"r":0.9824830293655396,"b":0.7004678249359131},"image_path":"grounding/zacks-research_20250713_204442/page_2/ChunkType.text_bd59c7da-5978-47c5-87b0-0f062e5c0577_0.png"}],"chunk_type":"text","chunk_id":"bd59c7da-5978-47c5-87b0-0f062e5c0577"},{"text":"Zacks Equity Research","grounding":[{"page":2,"box":{"l":0.0428706631064415,"t":0.9645091891288757,"r":0.1989971101284027,"b":0.9818480610847473},"image_path":"grounding/zacks-research_20250713_204442/page_2/ChunkType.marginalia_c39eaa40-643c-41f7-8b6b-0b7910a6c000_0.png"}],"chunk_type":"marginalia","chunk_id":"c39eaa40-643c-41f7-8b6b-0b7910a6c000"},{"text":"www.zacks.com","grounding":[{"page":2,"box":{"l":0.4526129961013794,"t":0.9663885831832886,"r":0.5662556886672974,"b":0.9811310768127441},"image_path":"grounding/zacks-research_20250713_204442/page_2/ChunkType.marginalia_4dd607d7-4462-4da7-86bb-41c80aaf457c_0.png"}],"chunk_type":"marginalia","chunk_id":"4dd607d7-4462-4da7-86bb-41c80aaf457c"},{"text":"Page 3 of 11","grounding":[{"page":2,"box":{"l":0.8825043439865112,"t":0.9645980000495911,"r":0.9739325046539307,"b":0.981627881526947},"image_path":"grounding/zacks-research_20250713_204442/page_2/ChunkType.marginalia_9c8f8dee-017f-44d6-9ca6-10af6c7dd025_0.png"}],"chunk_type":"marginalia","chunk_id":"9c8f8dee-017f-44d6-9ca6-10af6c7dd025"},{"text":"Reasons To Sell:\n\n▼ The United States and China’s tit-for-tat trade war is a major threat to the company. This is because the United States is the largest semiconductor manufacturing country, with China being its biggest importer. The trade war between the two countries has escalated over the past few years, and the U.S. government has imposed export restrictions on NVIDIA’s several AI chips. These restrictions have been significantly hurting NVIDIA’s data center chip sales in China. During the first quarter fiscal 2026 earnings call, the company revealed that it lost $2.5 billion in H20 chip sales in China during the quarter. It further expects to miss $8 billion in H20 sales during the second quarter.\n\n▼ NVIDIA’s near-term prospects might be hurt by softening IT spending. The still-high interest rates and protracted inflationary conditions have impacted consumer spending. Meanwhile, enterprises are postponing their large IT spending plans due to a weakening global economy amid ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical issues. This does not bode well for NVIDIA’s prospects in the near term.\n\n▼ NVIDIA’s reliance on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) for GPU production presents significant supply chain risks, particularly given the ongoing geopolitical tensions between China and Taiwan. A disruption in TSMC’s supply chain — whether due to geopolitical instability, trade restrictions, or capacity constraints — could severely impact NVIDIA’s ability to meet demand. Given the growing tension between the United States and China, further export restrictions on advanced AI chips could also limit NVIDIA’s ability to sell high-end GPUs in key markets like China, potentially impacting revenue growth. Additionally, U.S. regulatory scrutiny on AI chip exports to China continues to be a major headwind. If additional restrictions are imposed on selling AI accelerators to Chinese companies, NVIDIA’s growth prospects in one of its largest markets could be significantly hindered.\n\n▼ While NVIDIA is the dominant player in AI computing, competition is intensifying. AMD’s MI300 AI accelerators and Intel’s Gaudi AI chips are gaining traction, offering cost-effective alternatives for enterprises looking to diversify away from NVIDIA’s high-priced GPUs. Additionally, cloud giants like Amazon, Google and Microsoft are developing their own AI chips, which could reduce their reliance on NVIDIA’s GPUs over the long term. If these proprietary AI chips prove effective, NVIDIA may lose market share in its most profitable segment. Furthermore, NVIDIA’s Hopper and Blackwell GPUs require substantial capital investment from customers and cost-sensitive enterprises may opt for lower-cost solutions from competing vendors.\n\n▼ Despite strong revenue growth, NVIDIA’s gross margins declined in the first quarter of fiscal 2026, with non-GAAP gross margin slipping 12.5 percentage points sequentially to 61%. This decline was primarily due to a $4.5 billion charge related to H20 inventory and purchase commitments that became unsellable following the new U.S. export restrictions on H20 chip shipments to China. Also, higher production costs associated with transitioning to more complex AI systems weighed on gross margin. Additionally, operating expenses increased 43% year over year and 6% sequentially due to higher compensation and research & development investments. While necessary for long-term innovation, rising costs could eat into profitability if revenue growth slows in the coming quarters.

left for Industry Rank, right for Price.\n  • No log scales, error bars, or confidence bands are shown.\n\nDistribution & Trends :\n  • \"Industry\" (purple dotted): exhibits cyclical fluctuations, with several peaks and troughs, notably dipping around 2023 and spiking in 2024 and 2025.\n  • \"Price\" (black solid): relatively flat until 2023, then rises steeply, with some volatility in 2024–2025.\n\nAnalysis :\n  • The industry's Zacks Rank shows repeated cycles of rising and falling, with no clear long-term trend but notable volatility.\n  • The price remains low and stable until 2023, after which it increases sharply, suggesting a recent surge in value.\n  • The two series do not move in perfect synchrony; price increases most rapidly when the industry rank is relatively high
