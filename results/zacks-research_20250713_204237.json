Data centers are benefiting from solid adoption of fifth-gen EPYC Turin processors and expanding Instinct AI accelerator deployments across hyperscalers and enterprises. New product launches, such as the Ryzen 9 9950 X3D and Radeon 9070 series, have been a major growth driver. Gross margin expanded for the fifth consecutive quarter, driven by a more diverse Ryzen mix. AMD’s expanding partner base, including Microsoft, Oracle, DELL, HPE, Lenovo, and Supermicro, has been a key catalyst. The company is also expanding its portfolio through acquisitions. However, AMD has been suffering from stiff competition, particularly from NVIDIA. Export controls on certain Instinct GPUs to China posed a regulatory challenge. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.047,t=0.194,r=0.455,b=0.442), with ID 3d348337-1963-4879-be84-68a758ae6d0b -->\n\nData Overview\n<table><thead><tr><th>Metric</th><th>Value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>52 Week High-Low</td><td>$186.99 - $76.48</td></tr><tr><td>20 Day Average Volume (sh)</td><td>51,652,068</td></tr><tr><td>Market Cap</td><td>$233.7 B</td></tr><tr><td>YTD Price Change</td><td>19.4%</td></tr><tr><td>Beta</td><td>2.05</td></tr><tr><td>Dividend / Div Yld</td><td>$0.00 / 0.0%</td></tr><tr><td>Industry</td><td>Computer - Integrated Systems</td></tr><tr><td>Zacks Industry Rank</td><td>Top 13% (32 out of 246)</td></tr><tr><td>Last EPS Surprise</td><td>3.2%</td></tr><tr><td>Last Sales Surprise</td><td>4.5%</td></tr><tr><td>EPS F1 Est- 4 week change</td><td>-1.6%</td></tr><tr><td>Expected Report Date</td><td>08/05/2025</td></tr><tr><td>Earnings ESP</td><td>-8.3%</td></tr><tr><td>P/E TTM</td><td>39.4</td></tr><tr><td>P/E F1</td><td>40.2</td></tr><tr><td>PEG F1</td><td>1.6</td></tr><tr><td>P/S TTM</td><td>8.4</td></tr></tbody></table> <!-- table, from page 0 (l=0.047,t=0.455,r=0.460,b=0.882), with ID 93950f34-d161-4826-93a3-ea2134230296 -->\n\nSummary : This figure presents a time series line chart showing the relationship between stock price, EPS consensus estimates, and EPS surprises for a company from 2021 to 2025, with projections through 2027.\n\nline chart:\nTitle & Axes :\n  • Title: \"Price, Consensus & Surprise(1)\"\n  • X-axis: Years (2021 to 2027, labeled at yearly intervals)\n  • Left Y-axis: EPS (Earnings Per Share), range from 2.5 to 7\n  • Right Y-axis: Price ($), range from 40 to 220\n\nData Points :\n  • Price ($) (black solid line): Fluctuates between approximately $40 and $220, with notable peaks in 2024 and significant volatility.\n  • EPS Consensus (dotted lines by year):\n      – 2023 (purple): Declines from about 4.5 to 3.5\n      – 2024 (blue): Rises from about 4.5 to 5.5, then stabilizes\n      – 2025 (light blue): Rises from about 4.5 to 6, then stabilizes\n      – 2026 (orange): Starts at about 5.5 and remains flat\n      – 2027 (yellow): Starts at about 5.5 and remains flat\n  • EPS Surprise (green and red arrows): Green upward arrows indicate positive surprises, red downward arrows indicate negative surprises, scattered along the price line at various points.\n\nDesign Encodings :\n  • Price ($): Black solid line, right Y-axis\n  • EPS Consensus: Dotted lines, different colors for each year (purple, blue, light blue, orange, yellow)\n  • EPS Surprise: Green upward arrows (positive), red downward arrows (negative)\n  • Dual Y-axes: Left for EPS, right for Price ($)\n\nDistribution & Trends :\n  • Price ($) shows a general upward trend from 2021 to early 2024, peaking above $200, followed by high volatility and a decline into 2025.\n  • EPS Consensus for 2023 declines, while 2024 and 2025 estimates rise and then plateau.\n  • EPS Surprises (green arrows) are more frequent during periods of price volatility.\n\nAnalysis :\n  • The stock price and EPS consensus estimates generally trend upward until early 2024, after which price becomes volatile and EPS estimates plateau.\n  • Positive EPS surprises (green arrows) often coincide with price increases or stabilization.\n  • The divergence between price and EPS consensus in late 2024 and 2025 suggests market volatility or changing investor sentiment.\n  • Projections for 2026 and 2027 show flat EPS consensus, indicating expectations of stable earnings. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.469,t=0.195,r=0.965,b=0.453), with ID eba941da-b426-4dd6-804c-c05e552122e5 -->\n\nSummary : This bar chart presents the year-over-year (Y/Y) percentage growth rates for Sales and EPS (Earnings Per Share) from 2022 actuals through 2026 estimates, with both historical and projected data, and uses color and pattern coding to distinguish between metrics and timeframes.\n\nbar chart:\n# Title & Axes :\n  • Title: \"Sales and EPS Growth Rates (Y/Y %)\"\n  • X-axis: Years (2022 A, 2023 A, 2024 A, 2025 E, 2026 E)\n  • Y-axis: Growth Rate (%), with values shown above each bar.\n  • Tick labels: 2022 A, 2023 A, 2024 A, 2025 E, 2026 E\n\n# Data Points :\n  • Sales Growth Rates:\n    – 2022 A: 43.6%\n    – 2023 A: -3.9%\n    – 2024 A: 13.7%\n    – 2025 E: 21.7%\n    – 2026 E: 12.3%\n  • EPS Growth Rates:\n    – 2022 A: 25.4%\n    – 2023 A: -24.3%\n    – 2024 A: 24.9%\n    – 2025 E: 8.5%\n    – 2026 E: 46.0%\n\n# Design Encodings :\n  • Sales bars: solid green (actual), green with diagonal lines (estimate), solid red (negative actual), red with diagonal lines (negative estimate).\n  • EPS bars: solid dark green (actual), dark green with diagonal lines (estimate), solid brown (negative actual), brown with diagonal lines (negative estimate).\n  • Positive values use solid fill for actuals, hatched fill for estimates;

The latest MI300 series accelerator family strengthens its competitive position in the generative AI space. The accelerator is based on AMD CDNA 3 accelerator architecture and supports up to 192 GB of HBM3 memory. In comparison, NVIDIA’s H100 NVL dual-GPU card offers 188GB of HBM3 memory. Thanks to these features, AMD MI300X can efficiently run large language model training (up 80 billion parameters) and inference for generative AI workloads. AMD also launched the Instinct platform, which combines eight MI300X accelerators into an industry-standard design to address AI inference and training needs.\n\n- ▲ AMD’s footprint is strong in the data center market thanks to strong adoption of EPYC processors. It is benefiting from strong enterprise adoption and expanded cloud deployments. AMD’s expanding partner base that includes the likes of Amazon, Alibaba, Microsoft, Meta Platforms and Oracle is worth mentioning in this regard. In cloud, server CPU revenues increased year over year and sequentially as North American hyperscalers expanded fourth Gen EPYC Processor deployments to power their internal workloads and public instances.\n\n- ▲ AMD also expanded Zen-4 server product portfolio with the launches of Bergamo and Genoa-X. Bergamo presents significant growth opportunity given upcoming deployments by Meta, Dell, HPE, Lenovo, Supermicro, and other large server providers.\n\n- ▲ AMD’s investment in embedded business is noteworthy. Acquisition of Xilinx has helped AMD to consistently push the boundaries of capacity in emulation devices, with each generation nearly doubling its capabilities. The latest VP1902 adaptive SoC offers an impressive 18.5 million logic cells, doubling the programmable logic density of the previous generation Virtex UltraScale+ VU19P FPGA. Furthermore, it boasts twice the aggregate I/O bandwidth, delivering enhanced performance for demanding designs.\n\n- ▲ Strength in 7 nanometer-based processors is expected to strengthen the company’s competitive position in the commercial and server market against Intel. AMD is currently leveraging Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company’s 7 nm process technology, which in enabling it to deliver its advanced 7 nm chips faster to market. AMD Radeon RX 7900 series chipset design combines 5 nm and 6 nm process nodes, each optimized for specific chips in the GPU.\n\n- ▲ Management execution has been good. As of March 29, 2025, AMD had cash and cash equivalents (including marketable securities) of $7.310 billion compared with total debt of $4.16 billion.

The weakness in the Gaming and Embedded businesses remains a headwind for AMD’s near-term prospects.\n\n▼ In the traditional computing market, which still generates a chunk of its revenues, AMD is up against Intel's strong market position. With Intel systems so well entrenched, there is an obvious preference for system integrators to choose Intel processors over AMD. In the past, AMD was forced to resort to penetration pricing, which severely impacted its profitability. Now that it is getting into the higher-range segment, it is facing very stiff competition from Intel.\n\n▼ Moreover, AMD faces significant competition from NVIDIA in GPU market. AMD has had relatively greater success in the mobile segment and its current product lineup indicates that this focus will continue. However, competition in the mobile segment is likely to accelerate, with more ARM-based devices coming on the market.\n\n▼ AMD faces significant customer concentration from Sony and Microsoft. Consequently, loss of any one of these customers is anticipated to massively hurt the top line. Also, AMD derives a significant proportion of its revenues from outside the United States, subjecting the company to exchange rate volatility.\n\nAMD is suffering from declining PC shipments, intensifying competition in the traditional PC market as well as GPU segment. Customer concentration is a major headwind. <!-- text, from page 3 (l=0.054,t=0.037,r=0.936,b=0.306), with ID 31cd9a68-5f1c-417f-bbae-ae914e8b0b47 -->\n\nZacks Equity Research <!-- marginalia, from page 3 (l=0.043,t=0.965,r=0.199,b=0.981), with ID 2129286d-7df3-47b9-bc82-f57d8e3dd8d5 -->\n\nwww.zacks.com <!-- marginalia, from page 3 (l=0.453,t=0.967,r=0.565,b=0.980), with ID 8e13e8c8-b88d-461d-8f79-9e644643d57f -->\n\nPage 4 of 10 <!-- marginalia, from page 3 (l=0.883,t=0.965,r=0.974,b=0.981), with ID 373f5d86-730a-48bb-8739-f5f5266da0df -->\n\nLast Earnings Report\n\nAMD Q1 Earnings Top Estimates, Revenues Up Y/Y\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices reported first-quarter 2025 non-GAAP earnings of 96 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.23%.

investors' holding horizons: Zacks Rank and Zacks Recommendation. Each provides valuable insights into the future profitability of the stock and can be used separately or in combination with each other depending on your investment style. <!-- text, from page 9 (l=0.047,t=0.037,r=0.978,b=0.096), with ID 94f65e85-4756-421c-b6f2-5fd6bc7de6c0 -->\n\nZacks Recommendation\n\nThe Zacks Recommendation aims to predict performance over the next 6 to 12 months. The foundation for the quantitatively determined Zacks Recommendation is trends in the company's estimate revisions and earnings outlook. The Zacks Recommendation is broken down into 3 Levels; Outperform, Neutral and Underperform. Unlike many Wall Street firms, we have an excellent balance between the number of Outperform and Neutral recommendations. Our team of 70 analysts are fully versed in the benefits of earnings estimate revisions and how that is harnessed through the Zacks quantitative rating system. But we have given our analysts the ability to override the Zacks Recommendation for the 1200 stocks that they follow. The reason for the analyst over-rides is that there are often factors such as valuation, industry conditions and management effectiveness that a trained investment professional can spot better than a quantitative model. <!-- text, from page 9 (l=0.048,t=0.106,r=0.979,b=0.230), with ID f346fd51-23d5-447d-977c-b05fed6bf3c7 -->\n\nZacks Rank\nThe Zacks Rank is our short-term rating system that is most effective over the one- to three-month holding horizon. The underlying driver for the quantitatively-determined Zacks Rank is the same as the Zacks Recommendation, and reflects trends in earnings estimate revisions. <!-- text, from page 9 (l=0.048,t=0.243,r=0.978,b=0.300), with ID 75a448f1-0f1f-4c2f-818c-876ca23ae6ab -->\n\nZacks Style Scores\n\nThe Zacks Style Score is as a complementary indicator to the Zacks rating system, giving investors a way to focus on the highest rated stocks that best fit their own stock picking preferences. <!-- text, from page 9 (l=0.049,t=0.319,r=0.738,b=0.375), with ID 082ac25f-dc41-4e5a-91c2-26e56b6e34dc -->\n\nAcademic research has proven that stocks with the best Value, Growth and Momentum characteristics outperform the market. The Zacks Style Scores rate stocks on each of these individual styles and assigns a rating of A, B, C, D and F. We also produce the VGM Score (V for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual Style Scores into one score. This is perfectly suited for those who want their stocks to have the best scores across the board. <!-- text, from page 9 (l=0.049,t=0.381,r=0.737,b=0.455), with ID f62e52b5-1abc-4601-8dcf-77f43239b1e9 -->\n\nSummary : This figure presents four investment-related scores—Value Score, Growth Score, Momentum Score, and VGM Score—each assigned a letter grade.\n\ntable:\nScores and Grades :\n  • Value Score: F\n  • Growth Score: F\n  • Momentum Score: F\n  • VGM Score: D\n\nDesign Encodings :\n  • Each score is paired with a boxed letter grade.\n  • The VGM Score grade \"D\" is highlighted with a black background, while the others have a grey background.\n\nAnalysis :\n  • All individual component scores (Value, Growth, Momentum) received the lowest grade of \"F\".\n  • The composite VGM Score is slightly higher at \"D\", but still below average.\n  • The visual emphasis on the VGM Score suggests it may be the most important summary metric in this context. <!-- figure, from page 9 (l=0.750,t=0.342,r=0.975,b=0.457), with ID 06c2dc4c-cb86-43b6-8a62-997482a39cbd -->\n\nAs an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means buying stocks with a Zacks Recommendation of Outperform, which also has a Style Score of an A or a B. <!-- text, from page 9 (l=0.049,t=0.462,r=0.977,b=0.491), with ID e6d0bc06-0828-436c-95af-7ce37d6a6e38 -->\n\nDisclosures\n\nThis report contains independent commentary to be used for informational purposes only.

Gross margin expanded for the fifth consecutive quarter, driven by a more diverse Ryzen mix. AMD’s expanding partner base, including Microsoft, Oracle, DELL, HPE, Lenovo, and Supermicro, has been a key catalyst. The company is also expanding its portfolio through acquisitions.

To Buy:\n\n- ▲ AMD is strengthening its footprint in the artificial intelligence (AI) market through an expanding portfolio. The latest MI300 series accelerator family strengthens its competitive position in the generative AI space. The accelerator is based on AMD CDNA 3 accelerator architecture and supports up to 192 GB of HBM3 memory. In comparison, NVIDIA’s H100 NVL dual-GPU card offers 188GB of HBM3 memory. Thanks to these features, AMD MI300X can efficiently run large language model training (up 80 billion parameters) and inference for generative AI workloads. AMD also launched the Instinct platform, which combines eight MI300X accelerators into an industry-standard design to address AI inference and training needs.\n\n- ▲ AMD’s footprint is strong in the data center market thanks to strong adoption of EPYC processors. It is benefiting from strong enterprise adoption and expanded cloud deployments. AMD’s expanding partner base that includes the likes of Amazon, Alibaba, Microsoft, Meta Platforms and Oracle is worth mentioning in this regard. In cloud, server CPU revenues increased year over year and sequentially as North American hyperscalers expanded fourth Gen EPYC Processor deployments to power their internal workloads and public instances.\n\n- ▲ AMD also expanded Zen-4 server product portfolio with the launches of Bergamo and Genoa-X. Bergamo presents significant growth opportunity given upcoming deployments by Meta, Dell, HPE, Lenovo, Supermicro, and other large server providers.\n\n- ▲ AMD’s investment in embedded business is noteworthy. Acquisition of Xilinx has helped AMD to consistently push the boundaries of capacity in emulation devices, with each generation nearly doubling its capabilities. The latest VP1902 adaptive SoC offers an impressive 18.5 million logic cells, doubling the programmable logic density of the previous generation Virtex UltraScale+ VU19P FPGA. Furthermore, it boasts twice the aggregate I/O bandwidth, delivering enhanced performance for demanding designs.\n\n- ▲ Strength in 7 nanometer-based processors is expected to strengthen the company’s competitive position in the commercial and server market against Intel. AMD is currently leveraging Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company’s 7 nm process technology, which in enabling it to deliver its advanced 7 nm chips faster to market. AMD Radeon RX 7900 series chipset design combines 5 nm and 6 nm process nodes, each optimized for specific chips in the GPU.\n\n- ▲ Management execution has been good. As of March 29, 2025, AMD had cash and cash equivalents (including marketable securities) of $7.310 billion compared with total debt of $4.16 billion. Operating cash flow was reported at $939 million while free cash flow was $727 million in the first quarter of 2025.\n\nAMD is well-poised to benefit from strong demand for its x86-based microprocessors, semi-custom chips, and embedded processors, and GPUs driven by increasing adoption of AI and ML techniques.","grounding":[{"page":2,"box":{"l":0.04664278030395508,"t":0.037326380610466,"r":0.9793683290481567,"b":0.47754132747650146},"image_path":"grounding/zacks-research_20250713_204237/page_2/ChunkType.text_a4bc30da-e8ef-4cea-9af8-bc483dd27515_0.png"}],"chunk_type":"text","chunk_id":"a4bc30da-e8ef-4cea-9af8-bc483dd27515"},{"text":"Zacks Equity Research","grounding":[{"page":2,"box":{"l":0.042348891496658325,"t":0.9642965793609619,"r":0.19957348704338074,"b":0.9819225072860718},"image_path":"grounding/zacks-research_20250713_204237/page_2/ChunkType.marginalia_3f38d362-9fb9-4add-99aa-ec6122a09ddd_0.png"}],"chunk_type":"marginalia","chunk_id":"3f38d362-9fb9-4add-99aa-ec6122a09ddd"},{"text":"www.zacks.com","grounding":[{"page":2,"box":{"l":0.45262640714645386,"t":0.9664891958236694,"r":0.5663060545921326,"b":0.9809814691543579},"image_path":"grounding/zacks-research_20250713_204237/page_2/ChunkType.marginalia_060ed433-b4ce-4469-a1d8-ade25951e3e3_0.png"}],"chunk_type":"marginalia","chunk_id":"060ed433-b4ce-4469-a1d8-ade25951e3e3"},{"text":"Page 3 of 10","grounding":[{"page":2,"box":{"l":0.8826372623443604,"t":0.9647149443626404,"r":0.9752234220504761,"b":0.9813510775566101},"image_path":"grounding/zacks-research_20250713_204237/page_2/ChunkType.marginalia_c1517024-0aec-4ce1-9274-7f453144c93e_0.png"}],"chunk_type":"marginalia","chunk_id":"c1517024-0aec-4ce1-9274-7f453144c93e"},{"text":"Reasons To Sell:\n\n▼ AMD is suffering from a challenging macroeconomic environment, along with persistent inflation, which has forced the U.S. Federal Reserve not to cut interest rates year to date. The weakness in the Gaming and Embedded businesses remains a headwind for AMD’s near-term prospects.\n\n▼ In the traditional computing market, which still generates a chunk of its revenues, AMD is up against Intel's strong market position. With Intel systems so well entrenched, there is an obvious preference for system integrators to choose Intel processors over AMD. In the past, AMD was forced to resort to penetration pricing, which severely impacted its profitability. Now that it is getting into the higher-range segment, it is facing very stiff competition from Intel.\n\n▼ Moreover, AMD faces significant competition from NVIDIA in GPU market. AMD has had relatively greater success in the mobile segment and its current product lineup indicates that this focus will continue. However, competition in the mobile segment is likely to accelerate, with more ARM-based devices coming on the market.\n\n▼ AMD faces significant customer concentration from Sony and Microsoft. Consequently, loss of any one of these customers is anticipated to massively hurt the top line. Also, AMD derives a significant proportion of its revenues from outside the United States, subjecting the company to exchange rate volatility.\n\nAMD is suffering from declining PC shipments, intensifying competition in the traditional PC market as well as GPU segment.
